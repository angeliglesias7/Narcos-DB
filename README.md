# Narcos-DB

Mobile application for business management by drug traffickers. The system is made up of a mobile application developed natively on Android, using Kotlin, SQLite, Room DB and Model View View Model.

In the application there are different sections that allow the owner user to consult the different warehouses of money and drugs, the history of loans made, active contacts, the list of drugs for sale and bribes made to policemen, among other features.

To guarantee the security of the application, all the information is stored in a local SQLite database, since when communicating with a server it could be the case that a hacker intercepts confidential information for the business.

The project is not finished yet.
